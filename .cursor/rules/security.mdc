# 🔒 Security: Public Repository

## Critical Warning

**This is a PUBLIC repository. Never include:**

- Internal architecture details
- Business secrets or proprietary information
- Customer-specific data
- Sensitive internal processes
- Private API endpoints or credentials
- Internal configuration details
- Security vulnerabilities or implementation details
- Customer names or identifying information (unless publicly disclosed)

## Before Adding Content

Ask yourself:

1. Would this information give competitors an unfair advantage?
2. Does this reveal sensitive business logic or processes?
3. Could this expose security vulnerabilities?
4. Is this information already publicly available elsewhere?

**When in doubt, ask before adding potentially sensitive content.**

## What IS Appropriate

✅ Public API documentation
✅ SDK usage examples
✅ Deployment guides (generic)
✅ Community contribution guidelines
✅ Getting started guides
✅ Integration patterns (common, non-proprietary)
✅ Dashboard usage documentation

## Compliance

All content must:

- Be suitable for public consumption
- Align with AuditLedger's public messaging
- Not expose compliance-sensitive details
- Follow the principle of least disclosure

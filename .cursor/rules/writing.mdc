# Writing Guidelines

## Tone & Style

- **Audience**: Developers and technical decision-makers
- **Voice**: Active voice, second person ("you"), professional but approachable
- **Clarity**: Define technical terms, avoid unnecessary jargon
- **Brevity**: Be concise but complete

### Good vs Bad Examples

```markdown
# Good
You can authenticate using API keys or OAuth 2.0.

# Bad
Authentication mechanisms are available.
```

## Formatting Standards

### Headings

Use sentence case (capitalize first word and proper nouns only):

```markdown
# Good
## Getting started with the SDK
## API authentication methods

# Bad
## Getting Started With The SDK
## API Authentication Methods
```

### Code Blocks

Always specify the language for syntax highlighting:

```markdown
# Good
```python
client = Client(api_key="your-key")
```

# Bad
```
client = Client(api_key="your-key")
```
```

### Links

Use relative paths for internal docs, descriptive link text:

```markdown
# Good
See the [authentication guide](../api/authentication.md) for details.
Learn how to [configure your deployment](../deployment/configuration.md).

# Bad
Click [here](https://auditledger.github.io/api/authentication.html).
More info [here](https://example.com).
```

### Lists

- Use bullet points for unordered lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Start each item with a capital letter

### File Naming

Use lowercase with hyphens:

```
✅ quick-start.md
✅ api-authentication.md
✅ deployment-overview.md

❌ QuickStart.md
❌ API_Authentication.md
❌ deployment_overview.md
```

## MkDocs Admonitions

Use Material theme admonitions for important callouts:

```markdown
!!! note
    This is important information.

!!! warning
    Be careful with this approach.

!!! tip
    Here's a helpful suggestion.

!!! danger
    Critical warning - data loss possible.
```

## Content Organization

- Start with overview/context
- Provide clear prerequisites
- Include working examples
- Add cross-references to related docs
- End with "Next steps" when appropriate
